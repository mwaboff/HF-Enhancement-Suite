HackForums Enhancement Suite
==========
What is it?
----------
HF Enhancement Suite (HFES for short) is a userscript designed for the popular HackForums.net web forum. HFES adds a variety of functionality including the ability to subscribe to forums, quote multiple posts at once, and a complete interface overhaul of the private messaging system. Over 5000 people have installed this popular application.

Installation
----------
1. You first need to install your browser's userscript manager. Firefox users should use [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), Chrome users should use [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en), and Opera users should use the [TamperMonkey Beta](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/?display=en). I am not familiar with stable or up-to-date userscript managers in other browsers, but there may be some out there.h
2. Either navigate to the official [installation page](http://www.sublyme.net/site_media/userscripts/HFES.user.js) and your manager will automatically prompt you to install the script OR you can create a new script via your manager and paste the script's code directly in there.
3. Make sure your manager has HFES activated and log into your HackForums.net account.

Terms of Use
----------
You may learn from, use, and/or modify HFES to your own heart's content for personal use. The only restriction I have is distributing the modifications on HackForums.net. If you wish to do so, you must contact either myself or Emylbus (via HackForums.net) first.
